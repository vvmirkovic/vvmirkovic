# Simple Personal Website
This is a personal website that is created using simple html. It is used to show links to relevant links and some of my applications.

This repository also includes an html page for a WASM game I created with a couple friends. The game is not necessarily designed for going in the browser, which is why I decided to set up the WASM-javascript integrations here.
